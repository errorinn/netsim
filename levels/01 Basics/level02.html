
<p>In this level, you will learn how to create <strong>packets</strong> and send them from one computer to another.

<p>Pause the simulation and click on the <strong>packet</strong> that is sent from Bob's <strong>computer</strong>
 to Alice's <strong>computer</strong>. The information about a packet is contained in its packet <strong>headers</strong>.
 This is a simple packet that only lists information in the <strong>network layer</strong>. Note the two pieces of
 information contained in this header: <strong>srcip</strong> (the source of the packet) and <strong>dstip</strong>
 (the destination of the packet).
 
<h3>Level Objectives</h3>
 <p>To pass this level, you will need to send a packet from Alice to Bob. To do this:
 
 <ul>
	<li>Click the + button and add a new packet
	<li>We need to send this packet <strong>from</strong> Alice, so make sure she is selected in the From: dropdown menu.
	<li>You need to set the <strong>srcip</strong> and <strong>dstip</strong> headers in the network layer.<br>
            <em>hint: restart and pause the simulator to click on packets to see what the srcip and dstip header values are set to.</em></li>
        <li>Save your new packet by pressing <strong>Add</strong> button</li>
        <li>Restart the simulation and click the send arrow beside the newly added packet to see it in action!</li>

</ul>
